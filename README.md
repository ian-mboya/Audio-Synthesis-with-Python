# Audio-Synthesis-with-Python
## Awesome way to record and  process audio in Python

Recording audio and plotting it's attributes graphically is as easy as it comes. In this project, I demonstrate how to use PyAudio, Python's cross platform I/O library that gives you the ability to record and play audio.
Matplot is the tool that turns our audio output into a graphicall representation.



This project was inspired by freecodecamp and Assembly Ai and I thought it would inspire others as well.


# First Things First
## Setup

We will need to activate our Python Virtual environment.
If you are using Visual Studio Code, it is simple.
For this to work, you need to have Python extension installed on Visual Studio Code.

The next step is to activate our Virtual Environment which will allows us to install the packages we need for the project.
To activate the virtual environment press ctrl+shift+p to open the command pallete.

In the next step, select your environment type.
In our case we will select Venv instead of conda.
