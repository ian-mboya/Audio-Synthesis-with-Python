Recording audio and plotting it's attributes graphically is as easy as it comes. In this project, I demonstrate how to use PyAudio, Python's cross platform I/O library that gives you the ability to record and play audio.
Matplot is the tool that turns our audio output into a graphicall representation.



This project was inspired by freecodecamp and Assembly Ai and I thought it would inspire others as well.
